This is a project that contains a bunch of styles for basic elements. The most important part is the CSS file.
It contains a bunch of styles for basic HTML elements and some classes for different buttons.

## Usage

Copy the contents of the CSS file. Then expand on it within your project as you wish. This is meant to be a
minimal starting point to quickly make basic elements look nice.

## Development

I plan to continue working on this project to add more classes, containers, animations, and other stuff.
